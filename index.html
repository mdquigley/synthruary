        <p>Two synths cycle through a sequence of pitches. At random intervals between 2-10 seconds the second synth advances its sequence by 1, causing new harmonies and melodic syncopations as the phrase interacts with itself. Think piano phase but with discrete changes, so not really. Just some simple array slicing and random rumber generation.</p>
